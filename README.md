# My Personal Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I created it as part of my learning journey at Flatiron School.  

## Features
- A navigation bar with links to different sections  
- An **About Me** section introducing myself  
- A **Projects** section showcasing my work (placeholders for now)  
- A **Contact** section with my email and a button that shows a simple JavaScript alert  

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser  

## Future Improvements
- Add more projects with images and links  
- Improve the design with better colors and fonts  
- Add responsiveness for mobile screens  
- Maybe add animations or transitions with CSS/JavaScript
